		<h2>What Is a Media Query?</h2>
		<p>A media query consists of a media type and at least one expression that limits the style sheets' scope by using media features, such as width, height, and color. Media queries, added in CSS3, let the presentation of content be tailored to a specific range of output devices without having to change the content itself.

		<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
		<p>Media queries consist of a media type and can, as of the CSS3 specification, contain one or more expressions, expressed as media features, which resolve to either true or false.  The result of the query is true if the media type specified in the media query matches the type of device the document is being displayed on and all expressions in the media query are true.
</p>
<p>When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules. Style sheets with media queries attached to their <link> tags will still download even if their media queries would return false (they will not apply, however).</p>

<p>Unless you use the not or only operators, the media type is optional and the all type will be implied.
