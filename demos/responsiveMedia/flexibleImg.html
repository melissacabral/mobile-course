                <h2>Floated To The left</h2>
                <p>In this example, the image is simply floated to the left. It will never take more than 45% of its parent's size and it will never be smaller than 200px</p>

                <p>In this example, the image is floated to the right, and its container's overflow is set to hidden, so the image will be cropped from the right as the viewport reduces in size.</p>
