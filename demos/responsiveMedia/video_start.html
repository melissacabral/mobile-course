<h2>Your CSS is a mess</h2>
<b>This talk by Jonathan Snook was held at Smashing Conference 2012 in Freiburg, Germany.</b>
<p>CSS is easy. You take some selectors, add some properties, maybe a dash of media queries and presto, you have a beautiful site. And yet, as projects change and as teams grow, we begin to see the frustration build with increasingly complex selectors and overuse of !important. This session will look at common problems and solutions that will make your CSS (and your projects) easier to manage and easier to scale.</p>

<p> This video was embedded and made responsive with Css, no JS required! It is a little verbose and does required a little bit of math, but you can save it as a snippet.</p>

<p>In his own words...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a creator of striking designs, impeccable markup and code, and forward-thinking ideas and applications.

From front-end work to hardcore server-side challenges, I share tips, tricks and bookmarks on snook.ca, along with other publications online and offline. I've also coauthored two acclaimed books: Accelerated DOM Scripting with Ajax, APIs, and Libraries, and the approachable, widely-read The Art and Science of CSS.

In my off time, I've also teamed up with a dynamic group of world-class partners to form Sidebar Creative, who invent innovative applications, including Snitter, My Mile Marker, and Overheard.it.</p>

<h2>Creativity takes time</h2>
<p>A great two minutes video showing the importance of allowing yourself time to be creative and not settling on the first idea</p>
<!-- this code is old and can create issues, but it is easy to adjust for responsive sites-->
<object><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/VPbjSnZnWP0?hl=en_US&amp;version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/VPbjSnZnWP0?hl=en_US&amp;version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"  allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>
<p>this is the old embed code. iFrame is preferrable, but <code>&lt;object&gt; </code>tag is easier to manage in responsive sites. It does not scale quite as well</p>
